Notes:

Documentations is in ALU.pdf

The state diagram of the control unit is formed by overlapping all other described states and adding "& (op == the_state_opearation_number )",   in code there are comments saying if an operation has a different use for a state than its name suggests

To run: do run_alu.txt
To run while showing state at each clk: do run_detailed.txt
